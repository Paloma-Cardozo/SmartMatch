# ReDI School of Digital Integration – Matching App Solution

This is my solution to the ReDI School of Digital Integration challenge called **Smart Match**, a matching interface designed to simulate user interactions in a clean, responsive, and engaging layout. 
This is a static frontend project that displays a swipe-based matching interface. Each card includes a user profile with picture, bio, and interaction buttons. 
The goal was to create an intuitive UI inspired by dating or connection apps, with a strong focus on layout design and user experience. 
The layout was designed using only HTML and CSS. I gave special attention to border radiuses, shadows, and hover effects to simulate interactivity without using JavaScript.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5  
- CSS Flexbox  
- Responsive design techniques  
- Git & GitHub Pages  

### What I learned

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of **layering elements**, positioning buttons inside a card layout, and playing with spacing, sizing, and visual hierarchy. 
It also gave me a better grasp of how to build mobile-like interfaces using only HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

- Add JavaScript for actual swipe or match interactions  
- Use local storage or mock data to simulate user behavior  
- Explore transitions and animations for smoother visual effects  
- Learn how to implement responsive image loading and optimization
